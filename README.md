osu! Song Extractor (OSE!), rewritten.

### I can't seem to find the issues anywhere???
The issue tracker is hosted locally by myself, for myself. Currently, there is no way to report bugg yet, but most likely it is going to be through a boring google
forms page.

### What is osu! Song Extractor?
It is a very simple software that is designed to extract all of your osu! Songs from your library, and then MP3v2 tagging them with the background images.

### How do I use osu! Song Extractor?
A readme.html file will be bundled with the release of the software. Reading it will allow you to gain *knowledge* on how to operate such a software.

### Is it free?
In fact, the license for OSE! is [MIT](https://gitlab.com/jameshi16/OSE-Rewrite/blob/master/LICENSE). You can use it all you want!

### Download?
Compile it yourself for now, it's not stable enough to have a download.
