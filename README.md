# OSE-Rewrite

osu! Song Extractor (OSE!), rewritten.

## What is osu! Song Extractor?
It is a very simple software that is designed to extract all of your osu! Songs from your library, and then MP3v2 tagging them with the background images.

## How do I use osu! Song Extractor?
A readme.html file will be bundled with the release of the software. Reading it will allow you to gain *knowledge* on how to operate such a software.

## Is it free?
In fact, the license for OSE! is [MIT](https://gitlab.com/jameshi16/OSE-Rewrite/blob/master/LICENSE). You can use it all you want!

## Download?
Compile it yourself for now, it's not stable enough to have a download.
